## Run external script and get output as string.

```lisp
(with-temp-buffer
  (shell-command command-string (current-buffer))
  (buffer-substring-no-properties (point-min) (point-max)))
```

Use `\\` to escape special character.

```lisp
(split-string "foo bar") ;; => ("foo" "bar")
(split-string "foo bar" "a") ;; => ("foo b" "r")
(split-string "1.2.3" "\\.") ;; => ("1" "2" "3")
```
